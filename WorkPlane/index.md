<h1>Privacy Policy for ZJY Work Plane</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Current Date]</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Current Date]</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>ZJY Development Team ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Revit add-in "ZJY Work Plane" (the "Application") handles data when you use our software.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

<h3>2.1 Data We DO NOT Collect</h3>
<p>ZJY Work Plane is designed with privacy in mind. Our application:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Does not collect personal information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li><strong>Does not collect project data:</strong> We do not access, store, or transmit your Revit model data, project files, or any design information.</li>
    <li><strong>Does not track user behavior:</strong> We do not monitor how you use the application or track your modeling activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Does not use analytics tools:</strong> We do not integrate third-party analytics services or tracking tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Does not connect to the internet:</strong> The application operates entirely offline and does not transmit any data over the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Local Processing Only</h3>
<p>All application functionality occurs locally on your computer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work plane calculations are performed using only the geometry data already loaded in your active Revit session</li>
    <li>No data is copied, stored, or transmitted outside of your local Revit environment</li>
    <li>The application only reads existing model geometry to calculate optimal work plane positions</li>
    <li>All operations are temporary and do not permanently modify your model data beyond creating standard Revit work plane objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
<p><strong>We do not share any data with third parties</strong> because we do not collect any data. The application:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not integrate with third-party services</li>
    <li>Does not use external APIs or cloud services</li>
    <li>Does not include advertising networks or marketing tools</li>
    <li>Does not connect to analytics platforms</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<h3>4.1 No Data Retention</h3>
<p>Since we do not collect any user data or personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is no user data stored on our servers</li>
    <li>No data retention policies are necessary</li>
    <li>No user data exists to be deleted from our systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Local Application Data</h3>
<p>The application may create temporary files during operation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>These files are automatically cleaned up when Revit closes</li>
    <li>No persistent user data is stored locally by our application</li>
    <li>Standard Revit work planes created by the application become part of your Revit model and are managed by Autodesk Revit's standard data management</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. User Rights and Data Control</h2>

<h3>5.1 No Consent Required for Data Collection</h3>
<p>Since we do not collect any personal data or user information, no consent is required for data collection purposes.</p>

<h3>5.2 Application Removal</h3>
<p>To completely remove the application and any associated files:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Close all Revit sessions</li>
    <li>Navigate to: <code>C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\</code></li>
    <li>Delete the "WorkPlane.bundle" folder</li>
    <li>Restart Revit</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
<p>We implement appropriate security measures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The application operates within Revit's security framework</li>
    <li>No network connections are established</li>
    <li>No external data transmission occurs</li>
    <li>Application code follows Autodesk's security guidelines</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our application does not collect any personal information from users of any age, including children under 13. Since no data collection occurs, COPPA compliance concerns do not apply to our application.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at this location with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since our application does not collect user contact information, we cannot directly notify users of policy changes. We encourage users to review this policy periodically.</p>
